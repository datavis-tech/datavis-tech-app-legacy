Datavis.tech (pronounced data-viz-tek) is a creation tool.

This tool can be used to create works of interactive graphical computer programming.

One of the main use cases is for data visualization,
where data can come to life when presented in visual form.

A work in datavis.tech can be treated as any other work of creation.
For example it can be shared with others just by sharing a link.
It can be viewed, and you can know how many views it has.

Comments can be added to any work, to allow discourse to unfold.
Comments can annotate particular areas of a work.

A work changes over time.
A version of each work is saved permanently every day.

When viewing an old comment,
you can view the version of the work
as it appeared at that time.

After interacting with a work,
for example clicking and dragging,
you can link to the configuration you created
by sharing a link.

Articles published in Medium
(or any content platform that uses Embedly and/or OEmbed)
can include embedded works.

Related works can be tagged with the same tag,
indicating that they are related.
For example, works embedded into the same article
can be considered related.

Tags can be used to form collections.

Collections can be
 - viewed in list or grid form,
 - sorted by view count, creation date, or author
 - searched
 - embedded

Collections are also formed by
 - the home page (collection of all works)
 - any user (collection of works by the given user)
 - month
 - year
